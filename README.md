# Implementing new features:

- Make sure `mapASTToTypeNodes` handles parsing syntax for this feature, if not, add it. This
  requires adding a new `TypeNode` variant. Fill missing cases in functions that use `TypeNode` (use
  `pnpm check:types` to find all these places).
- Add tests and implement `evalT` for this feature.
- Add tests and implement `extendsT` for this feature.
- Add traverse logic in `traverse` function.
- In `eval-tree.ts` add new cases in `calculateNextStep` and `chooseNodeToEval`.
- Finally, update `EvalDescription` component.

## Implementing built-in types

To add a missing built-in type (e.g. `Pick`) you just need to implement it in the `global-types.ts` files according to `GlobalTypeFn` type.
